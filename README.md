## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

I am eager to embark on the next chapter of my career in tech, with a strong focus on expanding my expertise and exploring new opportunities in user experience design. I am passionate about creating intuitive and impactful digital experiences that prioritise the needs of users, and I am keen to contribute to projects where I can refine my skills and grow as a professional.

I am particularly excited about roles that allow me to collaborate with dynamic teams, solve complex problems, and continue learning in a field that is constantly evolving.

I've recently completed a 16-week Full-Stack Software Development Bootcamp with Headforwards and Code Institute following more than 8 years working in marketing, digital and social media. I'm passionate about improving user experience online and creating web applications while broadening my personal development and programming skills.

Previously I have also participated in some learning with SheCodes to develop an understanding of the basic principles of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, API's, Javascript, SEO, responsive design, verson control and associated tools and technologies.
